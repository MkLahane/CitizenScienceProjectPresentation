                        how to identify the unique patterns associated with their assigned type of land 
                        impact. Once participants have completed the tutorial, they may begin sorting 
                        through the image database and labeling whether or not their assigned land impact 
                        pattern is present.As users label the photos, Cartoscope collects the geolocation 
                        information for each categorized image and plots the results on a map that is 
                        available to the research team and participants. This allows participants to view 
                        their own contributions and the contributions of others, while also playing an 
                        instrumental part in the effort to protect Louisianaâ€™s wetlands.'
